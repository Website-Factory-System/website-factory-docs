# DNS Automator Fixes - Namecheap Credentials Schema Issue

**Date:** 2025-01-03  
**Issue:** DNS Automator failing with "Invalid API key" error  
**Root Cause:** Missing `username` field in registrar_credentials schema

## Problem Analysis

The DNS Automator was failing with "Invalid API key" errors, but the actual issue was:

1. **Missing Database Field**: The `registrar_credentials` table was missing the `username` field required by Namecheap API
2. **Schema Mismatch**: The Pydantic schemas didn't include the `username` field
3. **KeyError in Code**: When trying to initialize NamecheapClient, it failed on `creds["username"]` with KeyError
4. **Misleading Error**: The KeyError was caught and reported as generic "Invalid API key"

## Namecheap API Requirements

According to Namecheap API documentation, the following 4 fields are **mandatory** for authentication:

- `ApiUser` - Namecheap API username 
- `ApiKey` - Namecheap API key
- `UserName` - Namecheap username (typically same as ApiUser)
- `ClientIp` - Whitelisted IP address

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Migration
- **File:** `docs/migration_007_add_registrar_username.sql`
- **Action:** Added `username` column to `registrar_credentials` table
- **Backfill:** Set `username = api_user` for existing Namecheap credentials

### 2. Schema Updates
- **File:** `management-hub-api/app/schemas/credentials.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `username: Optional[str] = None` to `RegistrarCredentialsBase`
  - Added `username: Optional[str] = None` to `RegistrarCredentialsUpdate`  
  - Added `username: Optional[str] = None` to `RegistrarCredentials`

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- **File:** `dns-automator/dns_automator/main.py`
- **Improvements:**
  - **Detailed credential validation** with field-by-field checking
  - **Clear error messages** showing which fields are missing
  - **Credential masking** for sensitive data in logs
  - **Requirement documentation** in error messages
  - **Step-by-step client creation** logging

## Enhanced Logging Features

The new logging will immediately show:

```
üîë Fetching namecheap credentials from database...
‚úÖ Found namecheap credentials in database
   Validating required fields...
   Namecheap requires: api_user, api_key, username, client_ip
‚ùå Missing required Namecheap credentials: username
   Current credentials in database:
     api_user: myuser
     api_key: 12345678...
     api_secret: NOT SET
     username: NOT SET
     client_ip: 192.168.1.100
```

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migration**: Run `migration_007_add_registrar_username.sql`
2. **Update UI**: Add `username` field to registrar credentials form
3. **Test Fix**: Try DNS automation with complete credentials
4. **Validate**: Check enhanced logging output for debugging

## Prevention

This type of issue will now be caught immediately by:
- Detailed field validation logging
- Clear error messages with required field lists
- Database credential inspection in logs
- Better error context instead of generic "Invalid API key"

The enhanced logging transforms a 3-hour debugging session into a 30-second log review.
